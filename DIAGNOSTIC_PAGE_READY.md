# 🔍 Diagnostic Page Created!

I've created a diagnostic page to help us see what's wrong.

---

## 🧪 **Visit This URL:**

**http://localhost:5173/diagnostics**

---

## 📊 **What It Will Show:**

The diagnostic page will test:
- ✅ Is Supabase configured?
- ✅ Can we connect to Supabase?
- ✅ Can we query the posts table?
- ✅ Can we query the profiles table?
- ❌ Any error messages

---

## 📸 **What To Do:**

1. **Open:** http://localhost:5173/diagnostics
2. **Take a screenshot** of what you see
3. **Send me the screenshot**

This will tell us exactly what's broken!

---

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**

If everything is working:
- All 4 checks should show **"✓ Pass"** in green
- No error messages

If something is broken:
- Failed checks will show **"✗ Fail"** in red
- Error details will be displayed

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

After you visit the diagnostics page and send me the screenshot, I'll know exactly what to fix!
